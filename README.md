### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
This is Kubilay from Ä°stanbul!

Just want to summurize myself very quickly, I am a full-stack developer, focused on Angular, Vue, Node.JS, and .NET

Fortunately, I had chances to work with different kind of technologies/architectures like microfrontend (Zalonda Mosaic), microservices (Azure EKS, Custom Kubernetes Setup), serverless (on-top of AWS services). Oh by the way, I am a AWS Certified Developer Associate. <img src="https://images.youracclaim.com/size/680x680/images/2a15d440-edbe-44a2-890f-0a0caf7e1442/AWS-Developer-Associate.png" width="100" alt="accessibility text">

:punch:	Fullstack Developer <br />
:bicyclist:	Loves cycling and always up for :running:	<br />
:heart:	If you ask for my favorite languages & frameworks: Angular, Vue.JS, Node.JS (yes, TypeScript is something great <3), .NET <br />

Don't hesitate me contact with me! :wave:
